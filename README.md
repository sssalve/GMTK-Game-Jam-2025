Created for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam  
Theme: “Loop”

## Description

You are trapped inside a broken, glitched maze.  
The only way forward is through **death**.  

In **Killoop**, every death changes the world — opening new paths, altering hazards, and revealing secrets.  
Experiment, explore, and embrace the loop to find your way out.

## How to Play

### Controls
- **Move**: `Arrow Keys` or `WASD`
- **Jump**: `Space`, `W` or `Up` (Double Jump available)
- **Interact / Drink**: `E`
- **Pause**: `Esc`

### Goal
- Reach the maze exit.
- Certain obstacles can only be bypassed after you’ve died in specific ways.
- Certain deaths alters the world permanently in the next loop.

## Death Types

- **Spikes** → Instant kill; great for precision platforming.
- **Lava** → Burns over 3 seconds; survivable if you get out fast.
- **Poison** → Carry and drink to die after 10 seconds; removes double jump while carried.
- **Ghosts** → Spawn where you died. If you get too close, they chase and kill you.
- **Batteries** → Carry and eat to die after 3 seconds; removes double jump and has some other uses...

---

## Tips
- Most puzzles require dying **intentionally** to progress.
- Items restrict your movement; plan your path carefully.
- Ghosts can be obstacles… or tools.
