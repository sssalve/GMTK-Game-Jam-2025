Priority
- Nice platforming movement------------------DONE------------------------
	* Coyote time
	- snappy & smooth direction change
	* good jump feel
	* potetial double jump
	
- smooth player camera----------------------DONE------------------------
	- add camera shake eventually

- basic level layouts without hazards
	- Mark future hazard areas 
	- Plan out the path to win
	- potentially multiple routes?
	- Centeral zone with branching paths
	
- Death system
	- Checkpoints that look for player death triggers, then the zone does something
	- Checkpoints are individual objects and need to be specifically designed
		- 10 - 15 checkpoints
		
		
If time permits
- Narrative
	- You are trpped in a dying digital world
	- a small robot is stuck and needs you to find the exit before its all over
	- you keep looking for an exit and dying
	- the robot makes comments when you respawn to show that its a loop
	- Once you find the exit you can just go through or go back and grab the robot
	- he will be very happy if you save him
	
- visuals
	- death locations show a player ghost
	- areas where death should happen have a blurred/glitched effect that disapears when the player successfully dies
	
- Nice aesthetic for the digital world
	- might need to good at pixel art REALLY fast
